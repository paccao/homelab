# Architectural decision record (ADR)

An Architectural decision record (ADR) captures a single AD and its rationale; Put it simply, ADR can help you understand the reasons for a chosen architectural decision, along with its trade-offs and consequences.

The aim of this record is to keep track of major decisions I take in the design of my kubernetes cluster. It's also a way to showcase a little bit how my brain works and tackles problems, which hopefully can be useful to some.

To get started, copy the [template](template.md).
